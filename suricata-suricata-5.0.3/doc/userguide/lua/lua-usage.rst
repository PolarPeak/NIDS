Lua usage in Suricata
=====================

Lua scripting can be used in two components of Suricata. The first is in
output an the second one in rules in the detection engine.

Both features are using a list of functions to access to data extracted by
Suricata. You can get the list of functions in the :ref:`lua-functions` page.

Lua output
----------

Lua can be used to write arbitrary output. See :ref:`lua-output` for more information.

Lua detection
-------------

Lua script can be used as a filter condition in signatures. See :ref:`lua-scripting` for more information.
