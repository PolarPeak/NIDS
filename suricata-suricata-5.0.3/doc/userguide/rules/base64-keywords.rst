Base64 keywords
===============

Suricata supports decoding base64 encoded data from buffers and matching on the decoded data.

This is achieved by using two keywords, ``base64_decode`` and ``base64_data``. Both keywords must be used in order to generate an alert.

base64_decode
-------------

Decodes base64 data from a buffer and makes it available for the base64_data function.

Syntax::

    base64_decode:bytes <value>, offset <value>, relative;

The ``bytes`` option specifies how many bytes Suricata should decode and make available for base64_data.
The decoding will stop at the end of the buffer.

The ``offset`` option specifies how many bytes Suricata should skip before decoding.
Bytes are skipped relative to the start of the payload buffer if the ``relative`` is not set.

The ``relative`` option makes the decoding start relative to the previous content match. Default behavior is to start at the beginning of the buffer.
This option makes ``offset`` skip bytes relative to the previous match.

.. note:: Regarding ``relative`` and ``base64_decode``:

    The content match that you want to decode relative to must be the first match in the stream.

base64_data
-----------

base64_data is a ``sticky buffer``.

Enables content matching on the data previously decoded by base64_decode.

Example
-------

Here is an example of a rule matching on the base64 encoded string "test" that is found inside the http_uri buffer.

It starts decoding relative to the known string "somestring" with the known offset of 1. This must be the first occurrence of "somestring" in the buffer.

Example::

    Buffer content:
    http_uri = "GET /en/somestring&dGVzdAo=&not_base64"

    Rule:
    alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Example"; http.uri; content:"somestring"; \
         base64_decode:bytes 8, offset 1, relative; \
         base64_data; content:"test"; sid:10001; rev:1;)

    Buffer content:
    http_uri = "GET /en/somestring&dGVzdAo=&not_base64"

    Rule:
    alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Example"; content:"somestring"; http_uri; \
         base64_decode:bytes 8, offset 1, relative; \
         base64_data; content:"test"; sid:10001; rev:1;)
