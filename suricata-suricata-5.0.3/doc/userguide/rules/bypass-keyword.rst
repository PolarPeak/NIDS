Bypass Keyword
==============

Suricata has a ``bypass`` keyword that can be used in signatures to exclude traffic from further evaluation.

The ``bypass`` keyword is useful in cases where there is a large flow expected (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Youtube).

The ``bypass`` keyword is considered a post-match keyword.
